# Capital Planning Explorer: User Feedback Outline

Outlining the user research process to gather feedback from Capital Planning Explorer's beta launch.

## Timeline

Determining how much time each stage of the user research phase would take.

> [!NOTE]
> Timeline is tentative as we are trying to finalize details related to the launch date for CPE.

Things to consider when accounting for timeline:

- Determining survey period to collect initial feedback
- Going through survey feedback with Design and Capital Planning
- Scheduling interviews with participants
- Hosting individual interviews
- Setting up coordination for incentives and follow through with participants
- Scoring and synthesizing observations from interview
- Planning next steps after this feedback iteration

## Survey

Gathering information about our user demographics, overall feedback on previous experience with the older version of CPE, and current thoughts on the beta version.

### Goals

The design team plans to launch a user survey to understand the following:

1. What are common tasks are users trying to accomplish?
    > Figuring out if the new simplified user interface enhances their experience and prompts users to utilize CPE more.

2. Users previous experience with the older version of CPE.

    > What were users' pain points? How were these problems addressed? How did users try to accomplish their tasks?

3. Understanding what criteria is needed for our usability.

    > Gathering observations to help construct a scale to gauge the success rate in terms of usability.

### Delivery

Application Engineering has offered to add a banner on CPE to promote the survey for the friends and family launch.

### Outline

Here is an outline of the survey format:

#### Part 1: Inquiring About Previous Experiences with CPE

1. What is your occupation?

2. Have you used the Capital Planning Explorer in the past?

3. What was your objective(s) when using CPE?

4. How often did you use CPE in the past?

5. From very unsuccessful to very successful, please rank your experience using CPE to accomplish your task.

#### Part 2: Feedback on New Version of CPE

1. What did you try to accomplish with the new CPE?

2. From a range very unsuccessful to very successful, how satisfied were you able to accomplish your tasks?

3. What is one thing you would like to highlight about your experience?

4. What is one thing you wish that could be improved?

5. From a range of very unlikely to very likely, how likely would you recommend CPE to someone?

#### Part 3: Usability Study/Interview

1. Would you like to participate in a usability study or interview about your experience with CPE?

> [!NOTE]
> Something to look into is the [Community Compensation Fund](https://medium.com/nyc-opportunity/engage-nyc-residents-meaningfully-with-the-community-compensation-fund-74c3b5834644) for individuals willing to participate in usability testing.

## Usability Testing

The design team would like to conduct usability testing to understand the current usability of CPE.

> [!NOTE]
> Plans for usability testing listed below are tentative and are subject to change as we evaluate survey data as our first step.

### Goals

- Using research methods like System Usability Scale (SUS) to provide a high level score to determine our product's usability.

### Methods

We plan to conduct interviews where participants will run through tasks using CPE. These interviews would most likely be conducted remotely. Users will share their screens and the interviewer will record observations and ask questions to participants post-task.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We should aim to interview about 5 participants to obtain qualitative data through our usability interviews. The goal of obtaining qualitative data is to identify usability issues and about 85% of usability problems can be addressed with a sample size of 5.

Here is a list of potential tasks we would ask participants:

- Search and find a capital project through filtering by Community Districts.
- Search and find a capital project through filtering by City Council District.
- Locate the respective capital project on the map.
- Find the total commitments for a capital project.
- Find the commitment details for a capital project.
- Export data from a capital project.

To synthesize our findings, affinity mapping will be used to highlight key insights and themes.

Additionally, a SUS score wil be calculated to provide a metric on how easy our product was used for our audience. Average SUS score for products tend to score around 68.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For the sample size for SUS score, ideally we would want to aim for a minimum of 12-14 participants and a goal range of 20-30 participants. Since SUS can be calculated through post interaction with the product, this can be incorporated with the survey that will be sent via launch.
