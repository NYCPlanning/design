# Capital Planning Explorer/Capital Planning Explorer: User Feedback Outline

Outlining the user research process to gather feedback from Capital Planning Explorer's beta launch.

## Timeline

Determining how much time each stage of the user research phase would take.

> [!NOTE]
> Timeline is tentative as we are trying to finalize details related to the launch date for CPE.

Things to consider when accounting for timeline:

- Determining survey period to collect initial feedback
- Going through survey feedback with Design and Capital Planning
- Scheduling interviews with participants
- Hosting individual interviews
- Setting up coordination for incentives and follow through with participants
- Scoring and synthesizing observations from interview
- Planning next steps after this feedback iteration

### Estimated Time Commitments

- **Survey Period**: 2 weeks, at the end of Week 1, the design team will check in on responses and begin
to initiate interviews and organize data.

- **Usability Interviews**: 30-45 minutes per participant, 15 minutes of prep time before interviews for driver and observer to get acclimated.
    - Total time: 5 hours (5 interviews).

## Survey

Gathering information about our user demographics, overall feedback on previous experience with the older version of CPE, and current thoughts on the beta version.
The survey will collect quantitative data to calculate a System Usability Scale (SUS) score
to determine CPE's usability.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The minimum sample size we should aim for the survey should be at least **12-14 participants**
> for reliable results.

### Goals

The design team plans to launch a user survey to understand the following:

1. What are common tasks are users trying to accomplish?
    > Figuring out if the new simplified user interface enhances their experience and prompts users to utilize CPE more.

2. Users previous experience with the older version of CPE.

    > What were users' pain points? How were these problems addressed? How did users try to accomplish their tasks?

3. Understanding, from a mixed method user research approach, the usability of CPE.

    > **Gathering quantitative data to measure the perceived ease of use for our product** through a SUS evaluation.

### Delivery

Application Engineering has offered to add a banner on CPE to promote the survey for the friends and family launch.
Estimated turn around to create pop-up should take about 1-2 days.

### Outline

> [!NOTE]
> Updated survey questions are on Alchemer.

Here is an outline of the survey format:

#### Part 1: Inquiring About Previous Experiences with CPE

1. What is your occupation?

2. Have you used the Capital Planning Explorer in the past?

3. What was your objective(s) when using CPE?

4. How often did you use CPE in the past?

5. From very unsuccessful to very successful, please rank your experience using CPE to accomplish your task.

#### Part 2: Feedback on New Version of CPE

1. What did you try to accomplish with the new CPE?

2. From a range very unsuccessful to very successful, how satisfied were you able to accomplish your tasks?

3. What is one thing you would like to highlight about your experience?

4. What is one thing you wish that could be improved?

5. From a range of very unlikely to very likely, how likely would you recommend CPE to someone?

#### Part 3: Usability Study/Interview

1. Would you like to participate in a usability study or interview about your experience with CPE?


## Usability Testing

The design team would like to conduct usability testing to understand the current usability of CPE.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We should aim for a sample size of 5 participants for interviews for this initial round of feedback.

### Goals

1. Understanding, from a mixed method user research approach, the usability of CPE.

    > **Gathering qualitative data to highlight usability problems** our product through user interviews.

### Methods

We plan to conduct interviews where participants will run through tasks using CPE. These interviews would be conducted remotely. The interview most likely will be recorded for reference. 
There will be an interviewer and observer. Interview will drive by asking questions and leading through the interview while the observer will transcribing observations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We should aim to interview about 5 participants, about 85% of usability problems can be addressed with a sample size of 5.
> Additionally we should aim to conduct these interviews within the next two months as we are getting survey inputs.

Here is a list of potential tasks we would ask participants:

- Search and find a capital project through filtering by Community Districts.
- Search and find a capital project through filtering by City Council District.
- Locate the respective capital project on the map.
- Find the total commitments for a capital project.
- Find the commitment details for a capital project.
- Export data from a capital project.

### Compensation

The [Community Compensation Fund](https://medium.com/nyc-opportunity/engage-nyc-residents-meaningfully-with-the-community-compensation-fund-74c3b5834644)
is a fund where City Employees can apply for physical or digital gift cards to distribute
to participants who are NYC residents to compensate their efforts for participating in City activities. 

Specifically for CCF, participants who are not residents who are not actively being paid with a City funded contract are eligible.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since the a majority of our demographic for this initial round of user feedback are City Employees
> we should look into other incentives we can offer.
